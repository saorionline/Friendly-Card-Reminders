            <p class="prose">
                Three years ago, I was watching my best sales reps hit a ceiling. They knew the product inside and out, they had passion, but something was missing. They'd freeze during objection handling, rush through discovery, and worst of all—they sounded like robots reading from a script.
            </p>

            <p class="prose">
                That's when I realized the problem wasn't <strong>what</strong> they were saying—it was <strong>how</strong> they were saying it. Traditional sales training teaches you the words, but it doesn't teach you how to be human while using them.
